Inspiration
A lot of friends of mine have shown great interest in going to the gym. Besides how many bench presses or push-ups they did,
they like talking about the diet. As far as I know, most of them follow diet instructions strictly.
Then I wonder: is it possible that I can help people who don't go to the gym or have a personal trainer to know if they have a healthy diet?

What it does
The website takes in some personal information like age, height, weight, sex, and frequency of exercising to calculate the calories one needs per day.
And it also helps one to evaluate if one's one-day diet meets this necessary calorie intake.

How we built it
We build this using Visual Studio Code and work online together on Replit.

Challenges we ran into
None of us learned anything about HTML, CSS, or javascript before. So I guess we are really challenging ourselves to build this project.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that all of us are able to learn some knowledge in HTML, CSS, and javascript in such a short time!
And the final website looks nicer than we would anticipate.

What we learned
We are very glad that we choose to challenge ourselves to learn about building up websites. We learn to code with HTML, CSS, and javascript.
I believe that we won't feel confused next time we press F12 on a website.

What's next for Calorie Calculator
We expect that more food will be added to our database! And also more related factors would be considered to modify our evaluation of necessary calorie intake.
